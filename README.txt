CREDIT RISK ANALYSIS

# INFO
Analysis credit risk for customers is necessary to make bank loans safe and effective. Main objective of this project is to create predictive model that highly effective evaluate risk and spare traditional methods used in financial business. By using advanced machine learning algorithms, we can uncover patterns and relationships within the data that contribute to the prediction of credit risk.
Through exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and feature engineering, we will identify the most influential features and transform the data into a suitable format for modeling. Next, we will train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including naive Bayes, random forest, and neural network to determine the most accurate and reliable approach for credit risk prediction.
